	abstract = {Molecular machine learning has been maturing rapidly over the last few years. Improved methods and the presence of larger datasets have enabled machine learning algorithms to make increasingly accurate predictions about molecular properties. However, algorithmic progress has been limited due to the lack of a standard benchmark to compare the efficacy of proposed methods; most new algorithms are benchmarked on different datasets making it challenging to gauge the quality of proposed methods. This work introduces MoleculeNet, a large scale benchmark for molecular machine learning. MoleculeNet curates multiple public datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open source library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity and highly imbalanced classification. For quantum mechanical and biophysical datasets, the use of physics-aware featurizations can be more important than choice of particular learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {Highly accurate force fields are a mandatory requirement to generate predictive simulations. Here we present the path for the construction of machine learned molecular force fields by discussing the hierarchical pathway from generating the dataset of reference calculations to the construction of the machine learning model, and the validation of the physics generated by the model. We will use the symmetrized gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) framework due to its ability to reconstruct complex high-dimensional potential-energy surfaces (PES) with high precision even when using just a few hundreds of molecular conformations for training. The data efficiency of the sGDML model allows using reference atomic forces computed with high-level wavefunction-based approaches, such as the \$gold\$ \$standard\$ coupled cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD(T)). We demonstrate that the flexible nature of the sGDML framework captures local and non-local electronic interactions (e.g. H-bonding, lone pairs, steric repulsion, changes in hybridization states (e.g. \$sp{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}backslashrightleftharpoons sp{\textasciicircum}3\$), \$n{\textbackslash}backslashto{\textbackslash}backslashpi{\textasciicircum}*\$ interactions, and proton transfer) without imposing any restriction on the nature of interatomic potentials. The analysis of sGDML models trained for different molecular structures at different levels of theory (e.g. density functional theory and CCSD(T)) provides empirical evidence that a higher level of theory generates a smoother PES. Additionally, a careful analysis of molecular dynamics simulations yields new qualitative insights into dynamics and vibrational spectroscopy of small molecules close to spectroscopic accuracy.},

Both models obtain predictions of chemical properties by aggregating atom-wise contributions. These latent variables can serve as local explanations of a prediction and are obtained during training without additional cost. Due to their correspondence to well-known chemical concepts such as atomic energies and partial charges, these atom-wise explanations enable insights not only about the model but more importantly about the underlying quantum-chemical regularities. We generalize from atomistic explanations to 3d space, thus obtaining spatially resolved visualizations which further improve interpretability. Finally, we analyze learned embeddings of chemical elements that exhibit a partial ordering that resembles the order of the periodic table. As the examined neural networks show excellent agreement with chemical knowledge, the presented techniques open up new venues for data-driven research in chemistry, physics and materials science.},

Here we present a method based on neural architecture search to build accurate emulators even with a limited number of training data. The method successfully accelerates simulations by up to 2 billion times in 10 scientific cases including astrophysics, climate science, biogeochemistry, high energy density physics, fusion energy, and seismology, using the same super-architecture, algorithm, and hyperparameters.

ChemRxiv. Preprint. Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is a standard tool in most branches of chemistry, but accuracies for many molecules are limited to 2-3 kcal/mol with presently-available functionals. Ab initio methods, such as coupled-cluster, routinely produce much higher accuracy, but computational costs limit their application to small molecules. We create density functionals from coupled-cluster energies, based only on DFT densities, via machine learning. These functionals attain quantum chemical accuracy (errors below 1 kcal/mol). Moreover, density-based ∆-learning (learning only the correction to a standard DFT calculation, ∆-DFT) significantly reduces the amount of training data required. We demonstrate these concepts for a single water molecule, and then illustrate how to include molecular symmetries with ethanol. Finally, we highlight the robustness of ∆-DFT by correcting DFT simulations of resorcinol on the fly to obtain molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories with coupled-cluster accuracy. Thus ∆-DFT opens the door to running gas-phase MD simulations with quantum chemical accuracy, even for strained geometries and conformer changes where standard DFT is quantitatively incorrect.

We demonstrate that such methods enable well-behaved exchange-correlation approximations in very flexible model spaces, thus avoiding the overfitting found when standard least-squares methods are applied to high-order polynomial expansions. A general-purpose density functional for surface science and catalysis studies should accurately describe bond breaking and formation in chemistry, solid state physics, and surface chemistry, and should preferably also include van der Waals dispersion interactions. Such a functional necessarily compromises between describing fundamentally different types of interactions, making transferability of the density functional approximation a key issue. We investigate this trade-off between describing the energetics of intramolecular and intermolecular, bulk solid, and surface chemical bonding, and the developed optimization method explicitly handles making the compromise based on the directions in model space favored by different materials properties. The approach is applied to designing the Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW), a semilocal approximation with an additional nonlocal correlation term. Furthermore, an ensemble of functionals around BEEF-vdW comes out naturally, offering an estimate of the computational error. An extensive assessment on a range of data sets validates the applicability of BEEF-vdW to studies in chemistry and condensed matter physics.

AEVs provide the ability to train neural networks to data that spans both configurational and conformational space, a feat not previously accomplished on this scale. We utilized ANI to build a potential called ANI-1, which was trained on a subset of the GDB databases with up to 8 heavy atoms in order to predict total energies for organic molecules containing four atom types: H, C, N, and O. To obtain an accelerated but physically relevant sampling of molecular potential surfaces, we also proposed a Normal Mode Sampling (NMS) method for generating molecular conformations.

	abstract = {A combinatorially optimized, range-separated hybrid, meta-GGA density functional with VV10 nonlocal correlation is presented. The final 12-parameter functional form is selected from approximately 10 × 109 candidate fits that are trained on a training set of 870 data points and tested on a primary test set of 2964 data points. The resulting density functional, \$ømega\$B97M-V, is further tested for transferability on a secondary test set of 1152 data points. For comparison, \$ømega\$B97M-V is benchmarked against 11 leading density functionals including M06-2X, \$ømega\$B97X-D, M08-HX, M11, \$ømega\$M05-D, \$ømega\$B97X-V, and MN15. Encouragingly, the overall performance of \$ømega\$B97M-V on nearly 5000 data points clearly surpasses that of all of the tested density functionals. In order to facilitate the use of \$ømega\$B97M-V, its basis set dependence and integration grid sensitivity are thoroughly assessed, and recommendations that take into account both efficiency and accuracy are provided.},

Building on this observation we then demonstrate how this correlation between shape similarity and packing similarity can be used to generate potential lattices for molecules with no known crystal structure. Simple intermolecular interaction potentials can be used to minimize these potential lattices. Finally we discuss the many limitations of this approach.An investigation into using shape-similarity of molecules to generate putative crystal structures.},

	abstract = {An alternative to the density functional theory is the use of wavefunction based electronic structure calculations for solids. In order to perform them, the Exponential Wall (EW) problem has to be resolved. It is caused by an exponential increase of the number of configurations with increasing electron number N. There are different routes one may follow. One is to characterize a many-electron wavefunction by a vector in Liouville space with a cumulant metric rather than in Hilbert space. This removes the EW problem. Another is to model the solid by an impurity or fragment embedded in a bath which is treated at a much lower level than the former. This is the case in the Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) or the Density Embedding Theory (DET). The latter two are closely related to a Schmidt decomposition of a system and to the determination of the associated entanglement. We show here the connection between the two approaches. It turns out that the DMET (or DET) has an identical active space as a previously used Local Ansatz, based on a projection and partitioning approach. Yet, the EW problem is resolved differently in the two cases. By studying a H10 ring, these differences are analyzed with the help of the method of increments.},

This approach retains full access to the electronic structure via the wavefunction at force-field-like efficiency and captures quantum mechanics in an analytically differentiable representation.

This paradoxical result hints at the instability of the T′ phase in the presence of spontaneous generation of excitons, and we predict that it will give rise to a reconstructed ‘excitonic insulator' ground state5–7. Importantly, we show that in this monolayer system, topological and excitonic order cooperatively enhance the bulk gap by breaking the crystal inversion symmetry, in contrast to the case of bilayers8–16 where the frustration between the two orders is relieved by breaking time reversal symmetry13,15,16. The excitonic topological insulator is distinct from the bare topological phase because it lifts the band spin degeneracy, which results in circular dichroism. A moderate biaxial strain applied to the system leads to two additional excitonic phases, different in their topological character but both ferroelectric17,18 as an effect of electron–electron interaction.},

Additionally, we show that one can make all of the same predictions with the external potential rather than the self-consistent charge density, which allows one to circumvent the Kohn-Sham DFT scheme altogether. We then show that a self-consistent charge density found from a nonlocal exchange-correlation functional can be used to make energy predictions for a semilocal exchange-correlation functional. Lastly, we use a deep convolutional inverse graphics network to predict the charge density given an external potential for different exchange-correlation functionals and assess the viability of the predicted charge densities. This work shows that extensive deep neural networks are generalizable and transferable given the variability of the potentials (maximum total energy range ≈100 Ha) because they require no feature engineering and because they can scale to an arbitrary system size with an O(N) computational cost.},

While convolutional neural networks have proven to be the first choice for images, audio and video data, the atoms in molecules are not restricted to a grid. Instead, their precise locations contain essential physical information, that would get lost if discretized. Thus, we propose to use continuous-filter convolutional layers to be able to model local correlations without requiring the data to lie on a grid. We apply those layers in SchNet: a novel deep learning architecture modeling quantum interactions in molecules. We obtain a joint model for the total energy and interatomic forces that follows fundamental quantum-chemical principles. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance for benchmarks of equilibrium molecules and molecular dynamics trajectories.

We have isolated the genomic region encoding the alternative 5' terminus of dystrophin used in the brain. Primer extension and polymerase chain reaction assays on RNA demonstrate that this region contains an alternative promoter for dystrophin used in the brain. Physical mapping of this region indicates that this brain promoter is located greater than 90 kilobases 5' to the promoter used in muscle and 400 kilobases from exon 2 to which it is spliced. The large physical distance between the promoters, taken together with their known tissue selectivities, suggests that in certain patients a deletion of either dystrophin promoter might give rise to reduced dystrophin expression selective to brain or muscle. We have identified one such individual with specific deletion of the dystrophin muscle promoter, giving rise to Becker muscular dystrophy, and we predict that specific loss of the brain promoter may be one cause of X chromosome-linked mental retardation},

At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.},

Computer-aided retrosynthesis would be a valuable tool but at present it is slow and provides results of unsatisfactory quality. Here we use Monte Carlo tree search and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) to discover retrosynthetic routes. We combined Monte Carlo tree search with an expansion policy network that guides the search, and a filter network to pre-select the most promising retrosynthetic steps. These deep neural networks were trained on essentially all reactions ever published in organic chemistry. Our system solves for almost twice as many molecules, thirty times faster than the traditional computer-aided search method, which is based on extracted rules and hand-designed heuristics. In a double-blind AB test, chemists on average considered our computer-generated routes to be equivalent to reported literature routes.},

This is the case even as only a few chemical elements and blends have shown synthetic 2D forms. While hydrogen and metals are earth-abundant and form numerous compounds, rarely are 2D materials with only robust metal–hydrogen bonds. Here, a large new family of 2D materials is found from metal hydrides by high-throughput computational search augmented with first-principles calculations. There are 110 thermally and dynamically stable 2D materials that range from metallic materials to wide-gap semiconductors. A subgroup of these materials even varies from topological insulators to nodal-loop semimetals as well as from antiferromagnetic semiconductors to ferromagnetic half-metals. Unexpectedly, these monolayers resemble graphene in an ability to form weak interlayer interaction due to the variable multicenter bonding of hydrogen that eliminates the otherwise prevalent dangling bonds, rather than the covalent bonds between stacked layers as in previously reported synthetic 2D materials. This feature will favor potential experimental synthesis of these metal hydride monolayers.},

Machine learning (ML) is a technique for computer to learn how to perform a specific task using known data. It can be used in many areas and has become a hot research topic recently due to the rapid accumulation of data and advancement of computer hardware. The application of ML techniques in the design and fabrication of solar cells started slowly but has recently gained tremendous momentum. An exhaustive compilation of the literatures indicates that all the major aspects in the research and development of solar cells can be effectively assisted by ML techniques. If combined with other tools and fed with additional theoretical and experimental data, more accurate and robust results can be achieved from ML techniques. The aspects can be grouped into four categories: prediction of material properties, optimization of device structures, optimization of fabrication processes, and reconstruction of measurement data. A statistical analysis of the literatures shows that artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) are the two most applied ML techniques and the topics in the optimization of device structures and optimization of fabrication processes are more popular. This article can be used as a reference by all PV researchers who are interested in ML techniques.},

While their users are more than happy with the performance of this powerful technology, there is an emerging need to additionally gain better understanding of both the learning machine and the data analysis problem to be solved. Opening the nonlinear black box, however, is a notoriously difficult challenge. In this review, we report on a set of recent methods that can be universally used to make kernel methods more transparent. In particular, we discuss relevant dimension estimation (RDE) that allows to assess the underlying complexity and noise structure of a learning problem and thus to distinguish high/low noise scenarios of high/low complexity respectively. Moreover, we introduce a novel local technique based on RDE for quantifying the reliability of the learned predictions. Finally, we report on techniques that can explain the individual nonlinear prediction. In this manner, our novel methods not only help to gain further knowledge about the nonlinear signal processing problem itself, but they broaden the general usefulness of kernel methods in practical signal processing applications.},

Here, we present a machine learning model, trained on a database of ab initio calculation results for thousands of organic molecules, that simultaneously predicts multiple electronic ground- and excited-state properties. The properties include atomization energy, polarizability, frontier orbital eigenvalues, ionization potential, electron affinity and excitation energies. The machine learning model is based on a deep multi-task artificial neural network, exploiting the underlying correlations between various molecular properties. The input is identical to ab initio methods, i.e. nuclear charges and Cartesian coordinates of all atoms. For small organic molecules, the accuracy of such a ‘quantum machine’ is similar, and sometimes superior, to modern quantum-chemical methods—at negligible computational cost.},

The band structures, although first constructed over 30 years ago, still stand essentially correct. Ab initio pseudopotentials coupled to density functional theory are at the heart of modern theories for understanding the chemical bond in solids.

Improved methods and the presence of larger datasets have enabled machine learning algorithms to make increasingly accurate predictions about molecular properties. However, algorithmic progress has been limited due to the lack of a standard benchmark to compare the efficacy of proposed methods; most new algorithms are benchmarked on different datasets making it challenging to gauge the quality of proposed methods. This work introduces MoleculeNet, a large scale benchmark for molecular machine learning. MoleculeNet curates multiple public datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open source library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity and highly imbalanced classification. For quantum mechanical and biophysical datasets, the use of physics-aware featurizations can be more important than choice of particular learning algorithm.},

The results show that HfS2 monolayer under strains doesn’t display magnetic properties. When the strain is 0\%, the HfS2 monolayer presents an indirect band gap semiconductor with the band gap is about 1.252eV. The band gap of HfS2 monolayer decreases quickly with increasing compressive strain and comes to zero when the compressive strain is above −7\%, the HfS2 monolayer system turns from semiconductor to metal. While the band gap increases slowly with increasing tensile strain and comes to 1.814eV when the tensile strain is 10\%. By comparison, we find that the compressive strain is more effective in band engineering of pristine 1T-HfS2 monolayer than the tensile strain. And we notice that the extent of band gap variation is different under tensile strain. The change of band gap with strain from 1\% to 5\% is faster than that of the strain 6–10\%. To speak of, the conduction band minimum (CBM) is all located at M point with different strains. While the valence band maximum (VBM) turns from Γ point to K point when the strain is equal to and more than 6\%.},

Likewise, experimental complexity scales exponentially with the number of variables, restricting most searches to narrow areas of materials space. Robots can assist in experimental searches6–14 but their widespread adoption in materials research is challenging because of the diversity of sample types, operations, instruments and measurements required. Here we use a mobile robot to search for improved photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water15. The robot operated autonomously over eight days, performing 688 experiments within a ten-variable experimental space, driven by a batched Bayesian search algorithm16–18. This autonomous search identified photocatalyst mixtures that were six times more active than the initial formulations, selecting beneficial components and deselecting negative ones. Our strategy uses a dexterous19,20 free-roaming robot21–24, automating the researcher rather than the instruments.

It can be mapped as an explorative prediction problem. However, currently the performance of machine learning algorithms for materials property prediction is usually evaluated via k-fold cross-validation (CV) or holdout-test, which tend to over-estimate their explorative prediction performance in discovering novel materials. We propose k-fold-m-step forward cross-validation (kmFCV) as a new way for evaluating exploration performance in materials property prediction and conducted a comprehensive benchmark evaluation on the exploration performance of a variety of prediction models on materials property (including formation energy, band gap, and superconducting critical temperature) prediction with different materials representation and machine learning algorithms. Our results show that even though current machine learning models can achieve good results when evaluated with traditional CV, their explorative power is actually very low as shown by our proposed kmFCV evaluation method and the proposed exploration accuracy. More advanced explorative machine learning algorithms are strongly needed for new materials discovery.},

	abstract = {Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT) is the basis of modern computational approaches to electronic structures. Their accuracy heavily relies on the exchange-correlation energy functional, which encapsulates electron–electron interaction beyond the classical model. As its universal form remains undiscovered, approximated functionals constructed with heuristic approaches are used for practical studies. However, there are problems in their accuracy and transferability, while any systematic approach to improve them is yet obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that the functional can be systematically constructed using accurate density distributions and energies in reference molecules via machine learning. Surprisingly, a trial functional machine learned from only a few molecules is already applicable to hundreds of molecules comprising various first- and second-row elements with the same accuracy as the standard functionals. This is achieved by relating density and energy using a flexible feed-forward neural network, which allows us to take a functional derivative via the back-propagation algorithm. In addition, simply by introducing a nonlocal density descriptor, the nonlocal effect is included to improve accuracy, which has hitherto been impractical. Our approach thus will help enrich the DFT framework by utilizing the rapidly advancing machine-learning technique.},

Using the periodic table as representation, and full-Heusler compounds in the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) as training and test samples, a multi-task CNN was trained to output the lattice parameter and enthalpy of formation simultaneously. The mean prediction errors were within DFT precision, and the results were much better than those obtained using only Mendeleev numbers or a random-element-positioning table, indicating that the two-dimensional inner structure of the periodic table was learned by the CNN as useful chemical information. Transfer learning was then utilized by fine-tuning the weights previously initialized on the OQMD training set. Using compounds with formula X2YZ in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) as a second training set, the stability of full-Heusler compounds was predicted by using the fine-tuned CNN, and tungsten containing compounds were identified as rarely reported but potentially stable compounds.},

In this paper, we analyze an attack in an extremely limited scenario where only one pixel can be modified. For that we propose a novel method for generating one-pixel adversarial perturbations based on differential evolution (DE). It requires less adversarial information (a black-box attack) and can fool more types of networks due to the inherent features of DE. The results show that 67.97\% of the natural images in Kaggle CIFAR-10 test dataset and 16.04\% of the ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) test images can be perturbed to at least one target class by modifying just one pixel with 74.03\% and 22.91\% confidence on average. We also show the same vulnerability on the original CIFAR-10 dataset. Thus, the proposed attack explores a different take on adversarial machine learning in an extreme limited scenario, showing that current DNNs are also vulnerable to such low dimension attacks. Besides, we also illustrate an important application of DE (or broadly speaking, evolutionary computation) in the domain of adversarial machine learning: creating tools that can effectively generate low-cost adversarial attacks against neural networks for evaluating robustness.},

In this paper, we explore using DFT data from high-throughput calculations to create faster, surrogate models with machine learning (ML) that can be used to guide new searches. Our method works by using decision tree models to map DFT-calculated formation enthalpies to a set of attributes consisting of two distinct types: (i) composition-dependent attributes of elemental properties (as have been used in previous ML models of DFT formation energies), combined with (ii) attributes derived from the Voronoi tessellation of the compound's crystal structure. The ML models created using this method have half the cross-validation error and similar training and evaluation speeds to models created with the Coulomb matrix and partial radial distribution function methods. For a dataset of 435 000 formation energies taken from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), our model achieves a mean absolute error of 80 meV/atom in cross validation, which is lower than the approximate error between DFT-computed and experimentally measured formation enthalpies and below 15\% of the mean absolute deviation of the training set. We also demonstrate that our method can accurately estimate the formation energy of materials outside of the training set and be used to identify materials with especially large formation enthalpies. We propose that our models can be used to accelerate the discovery of new materials by identifying the most promising materials to study with DFT at little additional computational cost.},

Recently, computational methods have been built to predict crystal structure with success but have been limited in scope and computational time. In this paper, we review computational methods such as density functional theory and machine learning methods used to predict crystal structure. We also explored the breadth versus accuracy of building a model to predict across any crystal structure using machine learning. We extracted 24 913 unique chemical formulas existing between 290 and 310 K from the Pearson Crystal Database. Of these 24 913 formulas, there exists 10 711 unique crystal structures referred to as entry prototypes. Common entries might have hundreds of chemical compositions, while the vast majority of entry prototypes is represented by fewer than ten unique compositions. To include all data in our predictions, entry prototypes that lacked a minimum number of representatives were relabeled as “Other”. By selecting the minimum numbers to be 150, 100, 70, 40, 20, and 10, we explored how limiting class sizes affected performance. Using each minimum number to reorganize the data, we looked at the classification performance metrics: accuracy, precision, and recall. Accuracy ranged from 97 ± 2 to 85 ± 2\%; average precision ranged from 86 ± 2 to 79 ± 2\%, while average recall ranged from 73 ± 2 to 54 ± 2\% for minimum-class representatives from 150 to 10, respectively.},

The superb accuracy of the regression model is obtained by using a training set composed entirely of experimentally measured band gaps and utilizing only compositional descriptors. In fact, because of the unique training set of experimental data, the machine learning predicted band gaps are significantly closer to the experimentally reported values than DFT (PBE-level) calculated band gaps. Not only does this resulting tool provide the ability to accurately predict the band gap for any composition but also the versatility and speed of the prediction based only on composition will make this a great resource to screen inorganic phase space and direct the development of functional inorganic materials.},

	abstract = {High-throughput screening (HTS) campaigns in pharmaceutical companies have accumulated a large amount of data for several million compounds over a couple of hundred assays. Despite the general awareness that rich information is hidden inside the vast amount of data, little has been reported for a systematic data mining method that can reliably extract relevant knowledge of interest for chemists and biologists. We developed a data mining approach based on an algorithm called ontology-based pattern identification (OPI) and applied it to our in-house HTS database. We identified nearly 1500 scaffold families with statistically significant structure−HTS activity profile relationships. Among them, dozens of scaffolds were characterized as leading to artifactual results stemming from the screening technology employed, such as assay format and/or readout. Four types of compound scaffolds can be characterized based on this data mining effort:  tumor cytotoxic, general toxic, potential reporter gene assay artifact, and target family specific. The OPI-based data mining approach can reliably identify compounds that are not only structurally similar but also share statistically significant biological activity profiles. Statistical tests such as Kruskal−Wallis test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) can then be applied to the discovered scaffolds for effective assignment of relevant biological information. The scaffolds identified by our HTS data mining efforts are an invaluable resource for designing SAR-robust diversity libraries, generating in silico biological annotations of compounds on a scaffold basis, and providing novel target family specific scaffolds for focused compound library design.},

	abstract = {High throughput screening (HTS) assesses compound libraries for “activity” using target assays. A subset of HTS data contains a large number of sample measurements replicated a small number of times providing an opportunity to introduce the distribution of standard deviations (DSD). Applying the DSD to some HTS data sets revealed signs of bias in some of the data and discovered a sub-population of compounds exhibiting high variability which may be difficult to screen. In the data examined, 21\% of 1189 such compounds were pan-assay interference compounds. This proportion reached 57\% for the most closely related compounds within the sub-population. Using the DSD, large HTS data sets can be modelled in many cases as two distributions: a large group of nearly normally distributed “inactive” compounds and a residual distribution of “active” compounds. The latter were not normally distributed, overlapped inactive distributions – on both sides –, and were larger than typically assumed. As such, a large number of compounds are being misclassified as “inactive” or are invisible to current methods which could become the next generation of drugs. Although applied here to HTS, it is applicable to data sets with a large number of samples measured a small number of times.},

The ability to identify hits from a particular HTS assay depends largely on the suitability or quality of the assay used in the screening. The criteria or parameters for evaluating the ³suitability² of an HTS assay for hit identification are not well defined and hence it still remains difficult to compare the quality of assays directly. In this report, a screening window coefficient, called ³Z-factor,² is defined. This coefficient is reflective of both the assay signal dynamic range and the data variation associated with the signal measurements, and therefore is suitable for assay quality assessment. The Z-factor is a dimensionless, simple statistical characteristic for each HTS assay. The Z-factor provides a useful tool for comparison and evaluation of the quality of assays, and can be utilized in assay optimization and validation.},

ML models of atomization energies of organic molecules have been successful using a Coulomb matrix representation of the molecule. We consider three ways to generalize such representations to periodic systems: (i) a matrix where each element is related to the Ewald sum of the electrostatic interaction between two different atoms in the unit cell repeated over the lattice; (ii) an extended Coulomb-like matrix that takes into account a number of neighboring unit cells; and (iii) an ansatz that mimics the periodicity and the basic features of the elements in the Ewald sum matrix using a sine function of the crystal coordinates of the atoms. The representations are compared for a Laplacian kernel with Manhattan norm, trained to reproduce formation energies using a dataset of 3938 crystal structures obtained from the Materials Project. For training sets consisting of 3000 crystals, the generalization error in predicting formation energies of new structures corresponds to (i) 0.49, (ii) 0.64, and (iii) for the respective representations. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Here, we show that by employing an algorithm called the mean shift theory to a large amount of diffraction data in high-throughput experimentation, one can streamline the process of delineating the structural evolution across compositional variations mapped on combinatorial libraries with minimal computational cost. Data collected at a synchrotron beamline are analyzed on the fly and by integrating experimental data with the inorganic crystal structure database (ICSD), we can substantially enhance the accuracy in classifying the structural phases across ternary phase spaces. We have used this approach to identify a novel magnetic phase with enhanced magnetic anisotropy which is a candidate for rare-earth free permanent magnet.},

The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+˜n(r), ˜nn0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(rr0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas.

So far, transport signatures of such superlattices have been reported for graphene/hBN and graphene/graphene systems. Here we report moiré superlattices in fully hBN encapsulated graphene with both the top and the bottom hBN aligned to the graphene. In the graphene, two different moiré superlattices form with the top and the bottom hBN, respectively. The overlay of the two superlattices can result in a third superlattice with a period larger than the maximum period (14 nm) in the graphene/hBN system, which we explain in a simple model. This new type of band structure engineering allows one to artificially create an even wider spectrum of electronic properties in two-dimensional materials.},

	abstract = {We present an investigation of the atomic and electronic structure of graphene monolayer islands on the 6H-SiC(0001)(3×3) (SiC(3×3)) surface reconstruction using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS). The orientation of the graphene lattice changes from one island to the other. In the STM images, this rotational disorder gives rise to various superlattices with periods in the nm range. We show that those superlattices are moiré patterns (MPs) and we correlate their apparent height with the stacking at the graphene/SiC(3×3) interface. The contrast of the MP in STM images corresponds to a small topographic modulation (by typically 0.2 Å) of the graphene layer. From STS measurements we find that the substrate surface presents a 1.5 eV wide bandgap encompassing the Fermi level. This substrate surface bandgap subsists below the graphene plane. The tunneling spectra are spatially homogeneous on the islands within the substrate surface gap, which shows that the MPs do not impact the low energy electronic structure of graphene. We conclude that the SiC(3 × 3) reconstruction efficiently passivates the substrate surface and that the properties of the graphene layer which grows on top of it should be similar to those of the ideal material. 1 a rX iv :0 9 1 2 .0 8 1 0 v 1 [c o n d -m a t. m tr lsc i] 4 D e c 2 0 0 9},

With the rapid development of supercomputers and high-performance computations, high-throughput materials screening is a growing new power in materials science for the discovery of novel kinds of materials with desired functionality. Recently, many parent 3D bulks have been identified by high-throughput screening from materials databases for potential 2D materials, and several 2D materials databases are established through numerous efforts. In addition, on the basis of high-throughput computations for electronic properties and data-mining algorithms, several functional layered and 2D materials, such as electrode materials, photohydrolytic catalysts, half metals, piezoelectric monolayers and heterostructures, have been achieved. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the high-throughput screening of parent candidates for 2D materials and their further applications, and the challenges and perspectives are also briefly discussed. We highly expect that this review could lead the way forward in the discovery of novel 2D materials and provide a guide for the further development of 2D materials.

	abstract = {The successful exfoliation of graphene and other kinds of two-dimensional (2D) materials from their corresponding three-dimensional (3D) bulk counterparts has inspired researchers to screen layered bulk compounds as parent materials for potential 2D materials. With the rapid development of supercomputers and high-performance computations, high-throughput materials screening is a growing new power in materials science for the discovery of novel kinds of materials with desired functionality. Recently, many parent 3D bulks have been identified by high-throughput screening from materials databases for potential 2D materials, and several 2D materials databases are established through numerous efforts. In addition, on the basis of high-throughput computations for electronic properties and data-mining algorithms, several functional layered and 2D materials, such as electrode materials, photohydrolytic catalysts, half metals, piezoelectric monolayers and heterostructures, have been achieved. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the high-throughput screening of parent candidates for 2D materials and their further applications, and the challenges and perspectives are also briefly discussed. We highly expect that this review could lead the way forward in the discovery of novel 2D materials and provide a guide for the further development of 2D materials.

Here we use copper-oxide superconductors as an example to demonstrate the power of integrating combinatorial molecular beam epitaxy synthesis with high-throughput electric transport measurements. Leveraging this method, we have generated a phase diagram with more than 800 compositions in order to unravel the doping dependence of interface superconductivity. In another application of the same method, we have studied the superconductor-to-insulator quantum phase transition with unprecedented accuracy in tuning the chemical doping level.},
